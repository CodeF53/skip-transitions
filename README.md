## All changes (configurable)

**Removes the following intrusive transitions:**
- Title screen buttons fade in, which prevents them from being clicked
- Mojang logo fades out on top of other menus, freezing them temporarily

**Also removes the following cosmetic transitions:**
- Mojang logo fade in when applying resourcepack changes (now a cut)
- Toast notification slide in/slide out
  - The associated "whoosh" sound effect
