# Skip Transitions
### by TrufflezMC

**Removes the following intrusive transitions:**
- Title screen buttons fade in, which prevents them from being clicked
- Mojang splash screen fade out, which temporarily freezes whatever screen you were on

While not strictly necessary, also removes these transitions:
- Mojang splash screen fade in after loading the game or applying resource packs
